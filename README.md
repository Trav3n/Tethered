# Tethered

Before you start to commit or pull changes from GitHub, you need to make sure your Unity is setup properly. Open up the Unity Project that you want to setup for use with GitHub and go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor
On the right side of Unity, where the Inspector usually is, you will see a bunch of settings listed. From the “Version Control” drop down box, choose “Visible Meta Files”. From the “Asset Serialization” drop down, choose “Force Text”.
It is important that this is done. If you do not do this, your GitHub commits and pulls will NOT work.
